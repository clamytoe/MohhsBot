This is a **Python 3.6** script that I wrote using Anaconda but you should have no problem running it in just a Python installation. This is loosely based on my *bash* implementation of [randPic](https://github.com/clamytoe/randPic).

## Anaconda Installation
```bash
cd Documents\Projects\
git clone ...
cd MohhsBot
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Regular Installation
```bash
cd Documents/Projects/
git clone ...
cd MohhsBot
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
